# Temp vs. NO concentration - data analytics project

Worked in a group utilizing datasets of temperatures and Nitric Oxide (NO) concentration over the last few years to determine if lower winter temperatures contributed to high levels of NO concentration.

Using Python (pandas and numpy) and SQl, we seperated the data into seperate years and regions (of the Netherlands) and effectively concluded that there was no correlation between a regions's average winter temperature and its overall NO concentration.
