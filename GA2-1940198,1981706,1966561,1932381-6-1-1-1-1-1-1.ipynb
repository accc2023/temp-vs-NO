    "Three hypothesis generated as a team during first meeting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis 1: Temperature and fog display similar effects on O<sub>3</sub> concentration levels throughout the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis 2: An increase in temperature leads to a higher concentration of NO in the north of the Netherlands as compared to the south.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis 3: There is positive correlation between fog density and NH<sub>3</sub> concentration, with the strength of correlation varying with season.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Brief motivation on our interest and outcome for the hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "According to our GA1 analysis, we notice that there seems to be a seasonal correlation between temperature. fog and specifically NO/NH<sub>3</sub> concentration. The strength of a correlation with temperature seems be more explicit with these two compounds as compared to other pollutants, which is what originally our attention and interest in formulating these three hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that regardless of the chosen hypothesis, we expect to see a strong correlation between any pair of weather factor and compound, with higher peak compound concentration in the winter months as opposed to the warmer months of the year.\n",

    "----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Main idea:\n",
    "We believe that according to the data, the northmost region of the Netherlands, Groningen, which has relatively lower temperature levels has a higher concentration of NO compared to the southernmost region of the Netherlands, Limburg, which has relatively higher temperature levels. We have decided to focus on this main assumption as a basis for exploration so we are choosing hypothesis number 2.\n",

    "1. Annotating, brainstorming, and answering questions on keywords of the original hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original hypothesis: An <u>increase in temperature</u> leads to a <u>higher concentration</u> of NO in the <u>north of the Netherlands as compared to the south</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Increase in temperature</u>:\n",
    "What increase? How much of an increase? What season?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously the independent variable has been decided as (the change in) temperature. What remains to be decided is in what context this will be measured in as a simple change in temperature is too simple and not worth investigating. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is already clear that a lower temperature results in a higher NO concentration according to GA1. This is true on its own for one measuring station. Now we are going to investigate if the trend holds for different regions of the country or if other factors influence the results. For now, we have decided to investigate the north and south regions (specifically the area around Groningen/Friesland as contrasted to the Limburg area) as it is clear that these regions have the most signicant average changes in temperature as compared to other provinces.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Higher concentration of NO</u>:\n",
    "Peak or average? Measured per day, week, month, season?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to be measuring NO concentration peaks and means for each region solely in the winter period as this is a good focus season due to the amount of extreme recordings of NO concentration occuring at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>North of the netherlands as compared to the south or any other region</u>\n",
    "We can choose to explore and compare (pairs of) different provinces or regions, such as Groningen and Limburg, for example which should have a measurable amount of average temperature difference. We will be doing this for seperate four regions and comparing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Refined hypothesis:\n",
    "Dutch regions with average winter temperatures lower than 4.5 degrees Celsius record higher instances of NO concentration peaks over the winter median NO concentration of the country than those over 4.5 degrees average winter temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choosing the measuring stations:\n",
    "We choose the measuring stations based on different geographical regions of the Netherlands - north, south, south-west, and east.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Our approach:\n",
    "First, we query data from the tables in the database and create dataframes with data based on our chosen regions. We get the average temperature of each region in the winter period, then get the median of NO concentration of the country for the same period (we use the median to take into account for outliers). Then, we clean the data and use the results to test our hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Possible confounding variables:\n",
    "Some confounding variables could be the population density (which contributes to pollution levels), pollution from fossil fuel production in different regions, percentage of population living in urban or rural areas - more farms in rural areas contribute to higher NO concentration levels, and higher or lower humidity depending on proxiomity to coast.\n",

In contrast, the p-value for \"North vs. East\" is 0.0, which is below the standard significance level of 0.05. This implies that the NO concentrations in the North and East differ considerably but this is not a part of our actual hypothesis testing as both average winter temperatures are below 4.5. The difference provides support to our theory, suggesting that these two probably differ in significant ways albeit cannot be used to evaluate our hypothesis. Additionally,a proportions test was conducted  to further examine potential differences in NO concentrations between regions. Similar to the Z-statistics results, the proportions test revealed no statistically significant variations in NO concentration among all regions, except for \"North vs. East\". The p-values for the proportions test echoed the findings, with values close to 1.0 for all comparisons except \"North vs. East,\" where the p-value was 0.0\n",
